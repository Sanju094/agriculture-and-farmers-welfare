                    <h3 class="display-11">Fertilizer Subsidy</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Under a federally subsidized program, the central government pays fertilizer
                        companies to sell their products to farmers at below-market prices. The central government
                        provides
                        fertilizer manufacturers and importers subsidies so that farmers can buy them
                        reasonably.&nbsp;Distribution
                        of low-cost chemical or non-chemical fertilizers to farmers.<br>It is the difference between the
                        price paid to the fertilizer manufacturers (local or international) and the price charged to the
                        farmers. The rest of the burden will be borne by the government. This subsidy ensures the
                        following:&nbsp; </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Affortable Information for farmers</li>
                        <li>Stability in fertilizer prices</li>
                        <li>Reasonable returns in prepartion</li>
                        <li>Availability of adequate quantities of fertilizers as per the requirement of the
                            farmers.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The central government bears fertilizer subsidies. The need for fertilizer subsidy arises from
                        the governmentâ€™s fertilizer pricing policy. The fertilizer price policy is being implemented
                        with the following two objectives:&nbsp;</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To provide fertilizers at a low and affordable cost to farmers to encourage their use and
                            increase production.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>They are ensuring fair returns on investment made by the fertilizer industry to attract more
                            investment in the fertilizer industry.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>To achieve the first objective, the government keeps the selling prices of fertilizers stable and
                        uniformly low across the country.&nbsp;</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A power subsidy refers to the government receiving a reduced rate for the electricity supplied to
                        farmers. Farmers mainly use electricity for irrigation purposes. It is the difference between
                        the cost of generation and distribution of electricity to farmers and the price charged to
                        farmers. State Electricity Boards (SEBs) either generate or purchase electricity from other
                        producers such as NHPC and NTPC.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The power subsidy â€œincentivizes farmers to invest in borewells, pumping sets, tube-wells,
                        etc. Power subsidy is given on the power used to draw groundwater. Accordingly, it is a
                        subsidy for privately drawn and privately owned sources of irrigation. Power subsidy is the
                        difference between the price paid by the farmer for using electricity and the actual cost of
                        generating electricity. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The sustainability of electricity subsidies has come under a lot of pressure in recent years,
                        mainly due to the poor financial health of state electricity boards.&nbsp;States like Punjab and
                        Tamil Nadu have provided free electricity to farmers, leading to wastage and financial loss to
                        state electricity boards.&nbsp;

                    <br>
                    <p>The subsidy is provided to farmers by state governments under the Sub Mission on Agricultural
                        Mechanization (SMAM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), and the National Food Security
                        Mission for the purchase of various agricultural implements and machinery. (NFSM), The mission
                        for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palms
                        (NMOOP).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The government is helping farmers by providing subsidies for machinery purchases to improve farm
                        inputs and farm power availability. Under the UP Krishi Machinery Subsidy Scheme, farmers are
                        provided the benefit of subsidy on agricultural machinery through tokens. To help small and
                        backward farmers, the government has taken the initiative of providing machine subsidies.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <p>The Government of India and the State Governments launch several schemes to help alleviate the
                        farmersâ€™ plight. Thus, it focuses on each segment of the agricultural scheme. In every
                        sub-division, from procurement of raw materials to transportation and marketing of produce,
                        subsidies are available. Additionally, Haryana, the largest agricultural producer in the
                        country, is adopting modern machinery to encourage agricultural growth. </p>
                    <p>Thus, a few schemes like RKVY, Crop Diversification, State Plan, and NFSM support ISOPOM. The
                        government has provided an 80% subsidy to farmers on equipment to maintain poultry. Thus, the
                        subsidy will help purchase paddy straw choppers, happy seeders, straw management systems, and so
                        on that would otherwise cost too much. Also, the government provides subsidies through state
                        schemes for purchasing mulchers, cutters, spreaders, rotavator plows, etc.</p>

                    <p>The government of India provides irrigation facilities at lower rates than market rates. It is the difference between the maintenance and operating cost of irrigation infrastructure in the State and the irrigation costs charged to farmers. It can work through public utilities like canals, tube wells, dams, etc., which are constructed by the government and charge farmers no or low cost for their use. It can also be done through low-cost private irrigation equipment such as pumping sets.&nbsp;

                    <p>In India, micro-irrigation subsidy is covered under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (known as PMKSY) encourages micro-irrigation and its type. Its benefits can be promoted through heavy subsidies on the base. Kisan Irrigation Subsidy is a subsidy for the use of canal water provided by the government.&nbsp;Irrigation subsidy is the difference between the cost of operating and maintaining the irrigation infrastructure in the State and the irrigation costs charged to the farmers.  </p>

                        It can work by providing public goods like canals and dams that the government builds and charges low or no cost to farmers for their use. It can also be done through inexpensive private irrigation equipment such as pump sets. Irrigation subsidies have become unsustainable primarily because states have failed to develop a reasonable pricing model for canal water. Estimates showed that water prices did not cover more than 20 percent of canalsâ€™ operational and maintenance costs.&nbsp;

                    <p> To ensure that seeds are available to the farmers in times of natural calamities like floods, droughts, etc., a need was felt to establish a seed bank to maintain their foundation, and certified seeds can be maintained. Different crops/varieties can be used for such emergency needs. Under this component, crop-wise seed targets are set for each participating organization to be maintained in the seed bank every year.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>This subsidy is given to farmers so that they can compete globally. When a farmer or exporter sells agricultural products in the foreign market, he earns money for himself, and the government earns foreign exchange. As a result, agricultural exports are generally promoted as long as they do not harm the domestic economy.&nbsp;                    <br>
                    <p>Export subsidies are financial incentives provided to encourage exports. Export subsidies (direct payments, export credits, tax benefits) distort market prices, leading to above-market prices and overproduction in exporting countries and lower prices and less production in importing countries. In the short run, consumers in importing countries benefit from lower food prices. Export subsidies benefit countries where the production of subsidized products or their close substitutes is very low.&nbsp;                    <br>
